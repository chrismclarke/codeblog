# Codeblog

Codeblog is a hosted blogging platform that runs code in posts. [Learn more](https://jarredsumner.com/codeblog)

This README is a WIP. I don't have time to write documentation yet.

This repository consists of three npm packages:
- [`codeblog`](https://github.com/codeblog/codeblog/tree/master/packages/codeblog): provides access to the data used to render a Codeblog (and posts). Useful for making Codeblog templates.
- [`codeblog-components`](https://github.com/codeblog/codeblog/tree/master/packages/codeblog-components): provides a small number of silly components for use inside posts. These are entirely usable outside of Codeblog â€“ they're just React components.
- [`codeblog-template-simple`](https://github.com/codeblog/codeblog/tree/master/packages/codeblog-template-simple): the default template for codeblogs.
