A small batch of invites will go out by Monday.\n\n<section color="red">\n\n# Changelog for February 23rd\n\nThis is what I built today.\n\n# Components\n\nA <Glitter>Glitter component</Glitter> and a <Highlight>Highlight component</Highlight> are now available in the sidebar. Bringing the total number of components to the sidebar to...two.\n</section>\n\nThree \`color\` for \`<Highlight />\`\n- <Highlight color="yellow">color="yellow"</Highlight>\n- <Highlight color="green">color="green"</Highlight>\n- <Highlight color="pink">color="pink"</Highlight>\n\n# Click to use component\n\nClick \`<Glitter />\` and you get glitter. Clicking on a component in the sidebar adds it to your post.\n\nhttps://codeblog-shrinecache.storage.googleapis.com/4d5f5bdfbab822a0098ca7891e19451e.gif\n\nWhat\'s not shown: imports are handled automatically, even when the component has to be downloaded from npm.\n\n# Preview\n\nThe editor supports previewing posts without saving them. Before, you had to publish the blog post in order to see it.\n\n<img src="https://codeblog-shrinecache.storage.googleapis.com/26917b7c27b077118b86878c306f97b5.png" height={40} />\n\n# Edit metadata\n\nUntil today, the only way to edit the title, link, or summary of blog posts was secret. I didn\'t have time to give it a UI yet. Now, it\'s there. \n\n<img src="https://codeblog-shrinecache.storage.googleapis.com/d0bce9d33fecfe257f8eedd13ede6c0c.png" width={200} />\n\nI still need to add a social image option, however Google/Facebook seem to be okay at auto-detecting it, so it\'s lower priority for now.\n\n# Syntax highlighting\n\nThe editor now has syntax highlighting. Might still play around with the theme though.\n\nhttps://codeblog-shrinecache.storage.googleapis.com/0a63ad3f8634a934fd01cdf9da30d7fa.png\n\n# Help with components\n\nSomeday, I want Codeblog to have hundreds of components wired up for anyone to use (even if you don\'t know how to code) â€“ silly stuff, practical stuff (e.g. \`<TweetThread />\`), and useless stuff. I want most of these to be built by people using Codeblog.\n\nIf you have ideas for components, please email me: jarred@jarredsumner.com. Pull requests would be even better: https://github.com/codeblog/components. If you submit a PR for more components, I\'ll make sure you get access to Codeblog sooner.\n\n`;
